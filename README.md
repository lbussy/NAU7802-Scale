NAU7802 Scale Library
===========================================================

This library is based on and forked from the [SparkFun_Qwiic_Scale_NAU7802_Arduino_Library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Qwiic_Scale_NAU7802_Arduino_Library). It was eveloped to support the NAU7802 ADC on a [small development board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15242).

This repository is specifically in support of LBussy's projects, and may diverge from the original.
